# Coding conventions

* Package management in this project is done with uv.
* Use red/green test-driven development on this project.
* This project relies on asyncio, so all pytest runs need to employ timeouts to prevent hangs.
* Always log exceptions, pass through, or re-raise -- never swallow exceptions with bare `except Exception: pass`.
* Use idiomatic Python with proper type hinting.
* Comment every block of code with a description of its purpose so that humans can tell what's going on.

# Error handling and messages

A failure has two audiences, and each gets different text from the same exception: a human reading a terminal or a chat reply, and whoever reads the log afterwards.

* Human-facing text says what failed and what to do next, in plain language: `Config error: <detail> — check /etc/corvidae/agent.yaml`. Exception text and tracebacks belong in the log line, which names the exception type, the identifier, and carries the traceback.
* Name the identifier in every message: the path, URL, tool, MCP server, task, channel, record id, config key or field that failed. `Error: search failed` is unfinished; `Search failed for "foo" (QueryError); try a simpler query` is finished.
* State the remedy. When the caller can fix it, say how; when only a retry helps, say so.
* Exhaust the cheap rescue before failing: retry a transient, fall back to a simpler path, skip the corrupt record and return the rest, degrade to a partial result. Then report what was reduced.
* Log every rescue at warning level with the reason it was needed, so a fallback never hides a break. Where a fallback has a known edge, mark it `shortcut: <limit>, <when to upgrade>`.
* On rejected input, name the key, the rejected value, and the accepted values.
* Test the message, not just the raise. Assert that the identifier and the remedy appear; `pytest.raises` alone proves nothing about what the user reads.

# Process instructions

* If you are solving a GitHub issue, post the requirements and implementation plan as a comment on the issue before implementing.
* Check @docs/ before your work is complete and make sure the documentation is updated.
