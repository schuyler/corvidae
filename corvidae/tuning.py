"""Runtime-tunable settings resolution — the two-surface seam (Phase 2, WP2.3).

Every gate/appraisal/critique parameter in Phase 2 must be adjustable at
runtime without a daemon restart, through BOTH tuning surfaces (operator
directive 2, 2026-07-06):

  1. the agent-facing ``set_settings`` tool (``RuntimeSettingsPlugin`` →
     ``channel.runtime_overrides``) — per-channel;
  2. operator hot config reload (``ConfigWatcherPlugin`` →
     ``on_config_reload``) — global.

Plugins call :func:`resolve_tunable` at decision time — never caching the
resolved value at init — so both surfaces take effect immediately (trap #8).
Dotted keys (``"critique.sample_below_rate"``) are the namespace convention
for plugin tunables; the step-7 ``extra_body`` filter in ``agent.py``
excludes any dotted key from the LLM request body.

    Order (first hit returns):
      1. ``channel.runtime_overrides[key]``   — set_settings, per-channel

    ``channel`` may be any duck-typed object exposing ``runtime_overrides``.
    The dotted-path walk tolerates missing intermediate keys and non-dict
    nodes by falling through to ``default``.

    Intentional divergence: this does NOT reuse ``ChannelConfig.resolve``
    (channel.py) — that method merges a fixed set of typed framework fields
    last-wins; this is a per-decision first-hit-wins lookup for arbitrary
    dotted plugin keys. Do not unify them: doing so would reintroduce the
    FRAMEWORK_KEYS-only semantics this seam exists to escape.
